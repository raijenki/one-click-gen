# one-click-gen
It's a plugin for Oasis montaj (written in GXC) which allows the one-click generation and export of magnetic and gamaspectometric maps.
* Requires Geosoft 9.0 or higher;
* Grids are generated using Geosoft's BIGRID method with presort options;
* Everything is exported into 300 dpi geotiffs for compatibility.

## GAMASPECTOMETRIC GENERATOR (GAMAGEN)
The GAMAGEN generates and exports the following maps: Total Count, Thorium/Uranium/Potassium rates, their ratios and ternary maps.

## MAGNETIC GENERATOR (MAGEN)
The MAGEN generates and exports the following maps: Total Magnetic Intensity (TMI), Vertical/Horizontal Derivatives, Analytic Signal and Tilt Derivative.

## Usage
Just load the gx (either gamagen or magen), select the channels and press OK.
